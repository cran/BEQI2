```{r}
sel <- which(d$total < settings$pooling$targetarea[1])
tooSmall <- NULL
if (length(sel) > 0L) {
    tooSmall <- sQuote(
        apply(
            X = d[sel, c("YEAR", "OBJECTID", "ECOTOPE"), drop = FALSE],
            MARGIN = 1,
            paste,
            collapse = "-"
        )
    )
}
```

The total sample area is smaller than the minimum target pool area (`r settings$pooling$targetarea[1]`) for `r length(tooSmall)` combinations of waterbody- ecotope-year.

```{r eval=(length(tooSmall)>0L)}
tooSmall
```
